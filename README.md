Recommender systems try to capture the patterns and similar behaviors of people, to help predict what else a certain people might enjoy.
Recommender systems are utilized in a variety of areas and are most commonly recognized as playlist generators for video and music services like Netflix, YouTube and Spotify, product recommenders for services such as Amazon, or content recommenders for social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter or Instagram.

In this case study is built a movie recommendation system using Content-Based Filtering.
A Content-based recommendation system tries to recommend items to users based on their profile.
The user's profile revolves around that user's preferences and tastes.
It is shaped based on user ratings, including the number of times that user has clicked on
different items or perhaps even liked those items.
The recommendation process is based on the similarity between those items.
Similarity or closeness of items is measured based on the similarity in the content of those items.
